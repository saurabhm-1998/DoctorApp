# DoctorApp Using SpringBoot

The Doctor Appointment application is a web-based system that allows patients to schedule appointments with doctors. The application simplifies the process of booking appointments and managing patient-doctor interactions. Patients can search for doctors based on specialization, view doctor profiles, and schedule appointments conveniently.

## Frameworks and Language Used

The project is developed using the following frameworks and languages:

Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building web applications.

Java: The primary programming language used for developing the application


## Data Flow

### Controller

The Controller layer handles incoming HTTP requests and manages the flow of data.
It receives user input, validates it, and invokes the appropriate methods in the Service layer.
The Controller is responsible for processing requests, handling user authentication, and rendering views.

### Service

The Service layer contains the business logic of the application.
It performs operations on the data received from the Controller.
The Service layer communicates with the Repository to fetch or store data.

### Repository

The Repository layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval.
It interacts with the underlying database or data source to perform CRUD operations on the data.

## Project Summary

The Doctor Appointment application simplifies the process of scheduling appointments with doctors. Patients can search for doctors based on specialization, view doctor profiles, and schedule appointments at their convenience. The application follows the typical flow of data between the Controller, Service, and Repository layers. It utilizes the Appointment model to represent appointment data, including appointment details, doctor information, and patient details. The application can be extended to include features like real-time availability of doctors, patient medical history, and secure communication channels between doctors and patients, based on specific requirements.
